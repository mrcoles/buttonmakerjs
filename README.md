ButtonMakerJS
=============

A simple tool, written in javascript to generate CSS (and an image sprite for old browers) to create cross-browser buttons for use with `button` and `a` elements.

*The generated code also contains a comment with javascript to restore the values that you used to generate your buttons.* This way you can easily revisit a design without having to add back every color and also benefit from any future improvements/bug fixes in ButtonMakerJS.
